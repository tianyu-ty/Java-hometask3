Description: 
This code simulates a car wash station with multiple car wash positions and a maximum wait time for cars. An ExecutorService is used to manage car wash locations and a Car class that implements the Runnable interface to model the behavior of each car. The simulation involves 10 cars arriving at the station. Each car waits for a specified maximum time, and if the waiting time exceeds this limit, the car leaves the station. After all cars have been submitted for execution, the program shuts down the ExecutorService.
